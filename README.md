Privacy Policy for the Leaderboardle App from Multisideable

While Leaderbaordle stores a unique device identifier in the form of the UUID and a username associated with the user, these items are not used for anymore tracking other than associating the UUID and name to the scores that are submitted. Additionally, the username does not need to include a valid name on a government ID. It can be completely made up. The purpose of this app is to allow individuals to share their scores of these games and compare them without being tracked.
